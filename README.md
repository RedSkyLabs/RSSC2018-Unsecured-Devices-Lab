# RSSC2018 Unsecured Devices Lab

This lab will guide you through using an internet search engine called Shodan. Shodan crawls and indexes information about the devices it finds on the internet. This data can then be searched by anyone. Shodan records and indexes information such as host IP address and host name. It also performs a port scan and saves information about what it finds such as open TCP/UDP ports. It tries to initiate a session with the servies listening on those open ports and then indexes the data retrieved from that session.  The result is a powerful tool for gathering intelligence about potential attack targets. This information is often used by hackers of all shades of hats as they conduct their business.

### Warning - You will be using Shodan to query information about other people and you will be connecting to their unsecured equipment during the course of this lab. If you feel uncomfortable with this, please about this exercise now. If you intend to continue with this exercise, please be corteous and don't perform any malicious actions on gear systems that are not yours.
